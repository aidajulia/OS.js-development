# OS.js Development Packages

This repository contains Development packages for [OS.js](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js).

Follow [the official instructions](http://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-package-manager.html) on how to add this repository.

## IDE

This is my second attempt at creating a Interface Designer and IDE for OS.js.

*Last time I actually deleted my entire work (which was almost complete) by accident... And I did not commit it anywhere*... yeah!
