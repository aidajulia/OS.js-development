## IDE

This is my second attempt at creating a Interface Designer and IDE for OS.js.

*Last time I actually deleted my entire work (which was almost complete) by accident... And I did not commit it anywhere*... yeah!

#### Status

In progress, basic interface designing works. You can create, save and load projects.

#### TODO

It is somewhat usable, but the base design is not finished and needs some refactoring. Also some elements are not finished in "edit mode"

* [x] Simple project loading
* [x] Window Rendering
* [x] GUI Element toolbar
* [x] Proper project loading and sessions
* [x] Project saving
* [ ] Multiple window support
* [x] Adding elements
* [x] Removing elements
* [x] Parameter viewing
* [x] Parameter setting
* [ ] File Browser
* [ ] Source Editor Window
* [ ] Menu Editor
* [ ] Dropdown Editor
* [ ] Metadata Editor
* [ ] Inline fragment support


**BUGS**

* [ ] Save currently selected tab element so desiging tabs are less of a pain
