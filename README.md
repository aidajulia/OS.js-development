# OS.js IDE Project

This is my second attempt at creating a Interface Designer and IDE for OS.js.

*Last time I actually deleted my entire work (which was almost complete) by accident... And I did not commit it anywhere*... yeah!

## Status

In progress, but nowhere near usable. Currently experimenting and prototyping/laying groundwork

## Installation

Just add as a normal package.
